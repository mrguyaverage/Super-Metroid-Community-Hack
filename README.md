# Super-Metroid-Community-Hack
The main aspect of this project is to incorporate the entire community's ideas in a realistic and reasonable manner to create a hack of Super Metroid.

Anyone may participate and their ideas will be looked into to see if it's compatible with the main flow of the project.

Conflicting ideas will be discussed and hopefully everyone participating can reach a consensus.

We hope to breathe new life into a timeless classic in such a way that it could be entirely different than what the original developers intended.
