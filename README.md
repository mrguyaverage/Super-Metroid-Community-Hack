---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the following, aspects that are in


environment are those that currently seem to be agreed upon, and the rest are idea candidates to possibly improve on, finetune and eventually compare with each other to choose between them if they collide/conflict with other ideas.(edited)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# general suggestions/ideas:

° using SMART to pass rooms around as text files, and using SMART to not be limited to 28 tilesets but be able to use far more
° using a shared Github
° screenshots/demos/examples of tilesets, area, world layout, custom abilities for inspiration & visualization
° possibly using the template hack (or an improved/modified version) as base hack
° possibly exporting level data into a binary file, to then insert them with adjusted pointers (?)(edited)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# player-experience suggestions/ideas:
§ progression & story:

° finding coordinates of other planets from items or map-stations (which allow to find other planets and in the end the homeworld of the evil forces), but with 1 planet/submap not having such map-clue, and possibly 1 more strongly invaded planet with manipulated map-clue leading samus off-track to a dangerous planet (instead of final planet)
° having a certain few pairs of (custom?) major items with same ID so one takes only 1 (and might not know of the other's existence)
° having pairs of (or even more entangled) item-pickups that consist of 2 powerups, with same ID and having to actively choose between them
° having more than 100 items (or what the collectable max is) but only 100 can be obtained in any decision case, with few optional items (or even rooms/areas) only reachable in 1 route case and others in other routes
° planetary progression being similar to planet choices in a Star Fox game
° final planet's evil force homeworld, with evil force being a KiHunter civilization (commanding space pirates) rather than normal space pirates
° using the cutscene of Samus' ship flying to zebes (new drawing) with blinking pixel approaching the ship (resembling a missile fired from there towards samus, with hit sound/sprite) when last planet is approached
° Samus' ship diagonally crashing/landing into last planet's surface (with ceres ceiling tiles respaawning and falling from it due to getting hit) and breaking through shaktool-block rocks on the way down and into shaktool-block ground, creating a small crater with the ship (but then possibly being locked from there on away from 100%)
° downgrade applied to samus (maybe as temporarily malfunctioning until "virus" is fixed or by pirates hacked item?), or an event to lose abilities, to change mobility or fighting capacities(?)(edited)
° 2 (or more?) places at which the very same ability can be obtained as pickup (with same ID)?
° including grapple-jumps somewhere (possibly optional)
° preferably retain as many non-linear open world aspects as the original, with differently difficult routes, and sequence breaks a step more sophisticated than in original, but casual playthrough being easily accessible
° heat/acid/blizzard/damage-run sequence (not necessarily for speedbooster) possibly branching off into a non-linear escape (maybe with some dead-ends?)
° For Max%, 3 to 4 planet-backtracking trips are fine, for any% only about 2 should be involved
° fair challenge for quick players, but also rewarding thorough exploration and remembering previously inaccessible paths
° having a room like the title-screen's scientists+glasstank room to place an important item in the center (power suit, possibly with suit animation), and solving a few small (scientist-related) puzzles to get to it (and inability of collecting certain items without power suit)
° being able to choose between 2 new submaps/planets (together with ID-sharing pair of major custom item on each) after finishing the 1st task on 1st planet
° different ways of unlocking landing sites(?)
° maybe on 1 planet (after completing some task on it, possibly an early kind of tourian nuclear powerplant escape), a large desastrous catastrophe happens so samus has to flee from it and the planet is temporarily not visitable (and when flying away, one could use the planet explosion cutscene from credits (possibly slightly looking like a CF out of control), except cutting it off before credits and different music, and game continues after, with the planet playing the role of WS where rooms change their room states)
° animals encountered as dust enemies, eaten by Big Metroid (maybe even seeing the metroids sucking them dry)
° maybe 1 boss (and 1 mini-boss) per submap/planet (with few exceptions, and not all of them directly at the end and directly in front of new major upgrades?)
° swapping Ceres Ridley and Norfair Ridley, so on some planet, Ridley flees and flies off to Ceres station and is fought there
° bringing power-cells from planets back to the ship for further room access [apparently Prime 3 progression]
° gathering 4 (r-tank) cylinders on final planet/headquarter on it (in 4 corners of the map?) to repair the ship (possibly 1 in a final escape)
° major items obtained on later planets allowing for (previously unpassable, encountered) short-cuts on further exploration of previous planet(s) to reduce backtracking
° possibly Serris as 1 boss (with further room elements to make the fight interesting), aswell as sticking some enemy parts together for custom bosses (+sync movement and respriting maybe)

§ Samus abilities:

° spinjump out of morph
° backflip
° respin
° walljump boots as item
° ballspark
° water jetpack
° boostball
° wall-climbing rocketball
° wall-bouncing Havoc beam
° Shinespark as separate item from Speedbooster (which then only allows blue echoes)
° Varia/Barrier suit doing Gravity's damage-reduction to 25% of original damage
° Gravity suit not protecting from heat and lava (or also acid), but protecting from cold areas (possibly with the ice-physic tiles)
° Gravity only reducing original damage by 50% (which Varia normally does)
° Spacejump only working outside of liquids
° Power suit as (initially obtained) item and having no suit at first but (maybe modified) Justin Bailey sprites (where even water is dangerous, so maybe Scyzer's breathing bubbles from Gelid could be involved) and maybe also different hitbox for it
° having Varia and Gravity suit set up like Plasma and Spazer in the original game, so only 1 of them can be used at a time
° incorporating Mentlegen's 4 suits patch
° implementing Kejardon's shinespark-walljump-chaining
° slope-recharge for horizontal sparks
° maybe no normal sparks being possible and only ballsparks
° starting with morphball? (possibly conflicting with Power suit as item unless separate animation)
° bombs that can be used the same way as ice beam (not entirely sure what this means)?
° instead of reserves, interpreting them as cylinders [and maybe up to 12 of them]
° ice beam that makes frozen enemies fall?
° Melee attack (roundhouse kick or beam-saber "Samu-ray"?) with own button combo + animation and (invisible/resprited?) shortly existing Shot/chainsaw-beam/(pea-shot-charge beam-)SBA/pseudoscrew-projectile moving together with samus at fixed relative position (maybe before powerbeam as long-range-attack/longbeam is obtained) [0E: Turning around - on ground](edited)
° ship as gunship with weapon-attacks (using some enemy's projectiles and have the gunship use it, like redbeam maybe against a mini-boss right at a landing spot?)
° Justin Bailey Samus being able to crouch-walk before power suit
° throwing morphball at enemies to attack them(?)
° blue suit item(?)
° running even faster with speedbooster but losing hp from it
° 4 particles for Spazer-SBA, and possibly as spazer-particle rain/cascade/curtain effect
° alternate R-Tank usage for damage-power increase
° generally having items such that they have small drawbacks to make item-choices and the ability of disabling items actually progress-relevant
° splitting bombs and bombjumping as items/abilities?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
§ mechanic details

° powerbombs opening blue doors, drop rates, enemy and Samus damage, ammo/hp per expansion/tank,...?
° bomb-explosion timer; IBJ possible (depending on gravitation, or maybe some gravitations only a double-bombjump or different IBJ rhythm?)?
° black falcon's slow crumble blocks(?)
° samus speedbooster-running across/on liquids/lava/water(edited)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# rooms-layout suggestions/ideas:
§ layout:

° original layout with planet surface on top and then proceeding further and further down into the planet
° 1 planet, but on the right or left side of the ship, with an open vertical surface area and sideways progression into the planet
° 1 planet above Samus with open surface area beneath and underground areas above
° non-standard shapes of planets such as a torus
° having 1 heavier planet with Redesign-like gravitation, and 1 light-weight planet with Airy-like gravitation (or the lower gravitation could be for the Ceres-station asteroid-belt/nebula)
° 2-planet or planet+moon system with underground and surface areas in top and bottom planet, and free open space (maybe filled or designed as connecting water area with water streams using treadmills, maybe using Fusion's AQA tileset for it) between the planets, and some elevator, cannon or kind of maridia-tube connecting them
° 1 (smaller) planet where rooms in the submap loop sideways, maybe with an inpassable mountain or other obstacle in the middle to loop around the map to get to the other side (and loop earlier further down due to round shape) [while other planets might be too large for this]
-> the above options can be included into a multi-planet layout

° each "planet" corresponding to 1 submap
° open-space vertically and horizontally looping asteroid belt or gas planet/nebula submap as area (maybe with a Ceres-like station being located around here, and Samus lands with flying ship on a bigger asteroid, to provide her map-clues to scientists before final trip), with smaller and larger asteroids with caves and multiple entrances to find for them distributed all around
° multiple planets that have their own properties such as vegetation, environment and gravitation
° warp area / fast travel station [the more cylinders, the faster the fast travel, except not working at 7 and 11] (?)
° entire world playing underground(?)
° Kraid's Lair area as part of some submap?
° incorporating some optional special-playthrough styles to be considered via multi-functional rooms (low%, planet-order / RBO, pacifist, damageless...?)
° poisonous (green glowing swamp/jungle with fluorescent purple fog or chemical facility, maybe combined with "1 planet's natural catasrophe" idea?) area (with slow heat damage?)
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
§ rooms-contents:

° incorporating some of the unused special "glitched" tiles
° inverted liquid hanging from the ceiling (in anti-gravitation planet of 2-planet system)(edited)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# assembly suggestions/ideas:

° travel between planets happening via flying ship ASM (which probably still needs to be fixed or completed), with multiple unlockable landing sites on some planets(edited)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# art-graphics suggestions/ideas:

° each submap using its own unique map-screen room-colour (green, yellow, blue, red,...)
° using different CRE (via SMART's multiCRE) for different planets
° having 1 planet that doesnt use normal door connections through rooms, but just open air connections
° having another planet that (mainly) uses gates and gate-pole enemies to function as doors
° respriting of enemies and bosses
° possibly resprited suits(edited)
° (modified) hexagonal icons map screen before submap screen as way to display the 6 different submap areas/planets, and maybe use this screen to choose the next target to fly to
° HUD that displays room names (and possibly room editing authors)
° names displayed near corresponding sub-areas, for the individual submaps (of which each can have multiple sub-areas)
° respriting and using bright ground sand as lava (so it fits more to its density and behavior)
° phazon suit effect on top of gravity
° stitching some tilesets together that have the same theme going, for more variation and less tileset slots needed
° conflicting art-styles from various tilesets can be separated by using them on different planets/submaps(edited)

# music-soundfx suggestions/ideas:

° kraids_lair.flac file (with 2A03 bass near end
